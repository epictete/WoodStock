### Description

This our first React app.  
The goal is to create a basic one-page application.  
In this case, I chose to build a page around the theme of Breaking Bad, using the [Breaking Bad API](https://breakingbadapi.com/Documentation).  
The app fetches data from the API and displays the result as a grid of cards.  
There is a search field that allows the user to filter the results by name.
